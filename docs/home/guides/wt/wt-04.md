Now youâ€™ll see some more activity in the Plex connection section:

```
$ docker run --rm -it -v "/Users/mroche/plex-meta-manager:/config:rw" meisnate12/plex-meta-manager --run
...
| Connecting to Plex Libraries...
...
| Connecting to Main Movies Library...
...
| Loading Metadata File: config/Movies.yml
|
| YAML Error: File Error: File does not exist config/Movies.yml
...
| Metadata File Error: No valid metadata files found
|
| Main Movies Library Connection Failed
...
```

PMM may start cataloging your movies at this point; you cna hit control-C to stop that if it's happening.

We can see there that it connected to the Plex Library but failed to find that `Movies.yml` metadata file.

So far so good.

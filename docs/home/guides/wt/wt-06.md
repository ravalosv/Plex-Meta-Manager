This time you should see that the metadata file gets loaded:

```
| Loading Metadata File: config/Movies.yml
| Metadata File Loaded Successfully
```

And this time it will catalog all your movies.  This could take a while depending on how many movies are in that library.

Once this mapping is complete it will move on to build those three collections.

As it builds the collections, you should see a fair amount of logging about which movies are being added and which ones aren’t found.  Once it completes, go to Plex, go to your Movies library, and click “Collections” at the top.

You should see the three new collections:

![Finished Collections](finished.png)

When you click into each, you’ll see the movies that PMM added to each collection.

Each time you run the script, new movies that match the collection definition will be added.  For example, if you don’t have “The Razors’ Edge” now, when you download it and run PMM again it will be added to the Bill Murray collection.

If you download any of the missing 22 movies on the Vulture list, running PMM would add them to that collection.  And so on.

### What comes next:

Delete these three collections if you want, from both Plex and the metadata file [`config/Movies.yml`].

Edit `Movies.yml` to reflect the actions you want PMM to perform on *your* libraries.

TV Shows and other libraries work the same way as you've seen above.  Create a section under `Libraries:` in the config.yml, create a metadata file, define collections, run the script.
